      more: `A 3D height map was created for a section of Addis Ababa by subtracting the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from the Digital Surface Model (DSM), both derived from LiDAR point clouds. 
            LiDAR provides high-resolution data, capturing precise distances of surface features from the ground. In the visualization, building heights are represented with a color gradient: 
            light gray or white for ground level, followed by brown, orange, and purple for the tallest structures. 
            In the zoomed in image, green for ground level, followed by blue, yellow, and red for the tallest structures. The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) building, the tallest in East Africa, 
            is highlighted in red, standing prominently among surrounding buildings as shown in the zoomed in image.High-resolution DSM and DTM data are essential for a range of urban applications, 
            including mapping tree canopies, monitoring infrastructure, assessing flood risks, optimizing road networks, and supporting sustainable urban planning. Despite its advantages, LiDAR data 
            remain limited in Ethiopia due to high costs. While large-scale LiDAR surveys may be financially challenging, making such data available for major cities could significantly enhance urban 
            planning and development efforts.`

        `Integrating trees and green spaces into urban planning is essential for fostering healthier and more sustainable cities. 
         This map visualizes trees taller than one meter along with other green areas in Mekelle city, Tigray, Ethiopia.
         Such high-resolution mapping provides valuable insights for urban planners, helping guide the development of
         green infrastructure and optimize the distribution of vegetation across the city. Notably, the visualization highlights that
         most of Mekelle’s trees are concentrated along waterways, underlining the relationship between urban greenery and natural watercourses.`

      more:
        `While 3D representations may not yet be practical for routine quantitative analysis, they provide valuable 
         insights into landform characteristics and the spatial distribution of land cover classes across varied terrain.
         For 2023, the 3D land cover map of Addis Ababa and its surrounding districts shows that trees are largely confined to
         mountainous areas, whereas cropland and built-up areas dominate flat and gently sloping landscapes. 
         Built-up areas are noticeably expanding, often encroaching on croplands, while some rangelands have transitioned 
         into cropland, tree cover, or built-up zones. The inclusion of a highway road network highlights the pattern of 
         urban and suburban development along major roadways extending outward from the city. Incorporating 3D maps into 
         land cover or elevation analyses enhances visualization and provides insights that are not fully captured in 2D representations`

         generated using Datashader. It prominently highlights the Hugumbrda Forest, one of Ethiopia’s dry Afromontane forests. 
         The underlying dataset is globally available for the year 2020 at 10-meter resolution, providing a valuable resource for researchers studying 
         forest vertical structure, biomass estimation, and related ecological processes. Traditional land cover maps are typically limited to a horizontal view, overlooking the influence of terrain on land cover patterns. 
         The 2023 3D land cover map of Southern Tigray, Ethiopia, combines elevation data to illustrate how terrain shapes the distribution of land cover.
         The map shows that croplands and built-up areas are concentrated on flatter terrains, while trees and rangelands are more common in rugged landscapes.
         Integrating 3D land cover maps into planning processes can support smarter, more sustainable decision-making. Such visualizations are valuable for land-use planners, 
         policymakers, and other stakeholders pursuing environmentally responsible and climate-resilient development.`
